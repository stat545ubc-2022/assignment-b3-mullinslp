# STAT545B: Assignment B3 by Liam Mullins

## Overview
This resporitory was created by Liam Mullins to hold information related to his Assignment B3 for STAT 545B at the University of British Columbia. Liam chose to complete *option A* for this assignment, adding features to an already exisiting *BC Liquor Shiny App by Dean Attali*. Liam's modified version of this app can be accessed through the following [link](http://mullinsl.shinyapps.io/BCLIQUOR_VersionLiam_STAT545)

## Describing Liam's modified app
The modified app contains several useful features that make the user interface more helpful to access, including:
+ Feature #1: The addition of the BC liquor logo and a "cheers" gif. This contributes to the visuals of the app and adds a bit of fun to an otherwise plain interface.
+ Feature #2: Adds a multi-selector dropdown menu where users can search for products by country(ies) and alcohol subtype(s). This feature incorporates a select all/deselect all option should the user be initially unsure of which options to investigate further.
+ Feature #3: The output table has been made interactive. This means that individuals can search key words (related to products), examine the query hits easier, and see the total number of results.
